**Java** is general purpose, object oriented language developed by Sun Microsystems of USA in 1991.
Earlier Java was called *Oak* by James Gosling (one of the inventors of Java) which was later renamed as *Green* and then finally named as *Java*.
Java is the first language which gives us facility of the multi threading type of the programming.


## Setting up Java
Before starting with Java make sure to setup Java on your local machines. Follow the below steps to get going:

**Step-1:** Download & Install latest version of `jdk` from the below link üëáüèª  \
[https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/)
> `javac` - Java compiler  \
> `java` - Java Interpreter

**Step-2:** Create a text file and save it as `ClassName.java`

**Step-3:** Compile the .java file from command line. This generates a `ClassName.class` file in the same directory

**Step-4:** Execute the class file


## How to Write -> Compile -> Execute Java program?

Refer the [video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a356c745-b570-4e2b-9aeb-ab7a6e5fc1e4) or follow the below steps to run a Java program in Command Prompt:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a356c745-b570-4e2b-9aeb-ab7a6e5fc1e4


**Step-1:** Open the Command Prompt (CMD) or Terminal.

**Step-2:** Navigate to the directory where your Java source file (with a .java extension) is located using the "cd" command. 

**Step-3:** Compile the Java file into bytecode using the "javac" command followed by the filename with the .java extension. <br> For example, 
```bash
javac ClassName.java
```

**Step-4:** Once the compilation is successful, run the program using the "java" command followed by the class name (without the .class extension). <br> For example, 
```bash
java ClassName
```

**Step-5:** The Java program will now execute, and you will see the output (if any) in the Command Prompt.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure that you set path before compiling the java file. Without set path command line won't recognize javac.


## How to set path on command prompt?
> Method 1: In this method, you need to set the path every time you open command prompt.	\
> To set path you need to copy the bin location of JDK Installtaion directory.

**Step-1:** Determine the location of your Java Development Kit (JDK) installation directory.

**Step-2:** Open the Command Prompt (CMD).

**Step-3:** Set the path to your JDK Installation bin folder
```bash
set path = "(Bin Location)"
```

**Step-4:** Compile using `javac` and execute using `java` commands.

<br>

> Method 2: In this method, we set the global path variable to JDK bin location and hence we do not need to set path everytime we open CMD before executing java program.

**Step-1:** Go to properties from `This PC`  

**Step-2:** Click on `Advanced System Settings`

**Step-3:** Select `Environment Variables`

**Step-4:** Click `New..`

**Step-5:** Set Variable name as `path` and Variable value as `locaion of JDK bin`
<br> Click OK
