## JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
- JVM is an interpreter.
- JVM is the main component of Java which makes it platform independent.
- When code is compiled by Java compiler it converts the program into a special format called as byte code.
- JVM in the system interprets or translates the byte code into the machine understandable code of that machine.
- Components of JVM are:
	- Java compiler: converts the .java file to .class file.
	- Run time Memory area: allocates memory for different data.
	- Method area: store the code of the program that is currently being executed.
	- Heap: store variables of the objects. Stack: store data when calling methods.
	- Program Counter registers: contains the address of the code.
	- Execution engine: special block with Interpreter and JIT
	- Interpreter translates the byte code into the machine understandable code of that machine.
	- Just in Time (JIT): immediately executes the machine code.
